**Hi!** 


**Demo:**
This repository contains a simple Streamlit app that demonstrates its ease of use and benefits. The app allows you to:
navigate through pages, select different roles (regular user, admin, super admin) and confirm that they have different accesses.
Also, it demonstrates the usage of fragments and data visualization capabilities.
Try it out and see how easy it is to build and deploy a web application with Streamlit!

**Conclusion:**
Streamlit is a game-changer for building and deploying web applications quickly and easily. Its simplicity, interactivity, and collaboration features make it perfect for data science, machine learning, and visualization projects. Give it a try and see what you can build!
